## Email Search Lesson - Don't Trust Sender Names

**What happened:**
- User asked about the IronClad Ambassador Agreement email
- Anthropic's welcome email said it would come from "IronClad"
- I searched for `from:ironclad` and found nothing
- User corrected me - the email WAS in the inbox
- Actual sender: **Docusign** (`dse_NA4@docusign.net`), not IronClad

**Why I missed it:**
- Searched too narrowly based on the sender name mentioned in the reference email
- Didn't do a broad recent search first
- Trusted the "IronClad" reference literally instead of thinking about document signing services

**How to avoid this in the future:**
1. **Always search broadly first** - check recent emails (`newer_than:2d --max 20`) before narrowing
2. **Don't rely solely on sender names from other emails** - they might be approximate or wrong
3. **Think about what service would actually send it** - contracts/agreements usually come via Docusign, HelloSign, Adobe Sign, etc.
4. **Search by subject keywords** instead of just sender when possible
5. **If a search fails, immediately try broader searches** before telling the user "not found"

**Better search sequence:**
1. Recent emails first: `newer_than:2d --max 20`
2. Subject keywords: `subject:(agreement OR sign OR contract)`
3. Then try specific senders if still not found
